## A News-Navigation Game

#### Problem
One major factor in the spread of fake news is the sheer volume of news media; no single person can be expected to absorb the sheer amount of news being produced every day, much less check its veracity or examine its biases. As a result, most must have to accept the news we are presented, biased and complicated as it may be, as the truth. The news we consume informs our knowledge and our knowledge informs our actions; as a result, the news we consume-and the veracity thereof-has an immense impact on how we perceive reality and how we affect it. While it’s impossible to interrogate every piece of news we encounter in the day, that doesn’t mean that we have to blindly accept it or forget to think about it critically.

#### Solution
<p>By having players interact with fictional news cycles, choose what information to view, and interrogate it’s validity, we hope that they will reflect on and reconsider how they engage with the news media they consume in their real lives.
